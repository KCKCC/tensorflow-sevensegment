# Installations
##Anaconda: 
	It contains Python and commonly used packages, such as NumPy, Pandas and other matrix computing suites, Python V2 and V3 are not compatible, I choose V3, unless you have used V2 in large numbers before.
##Tensorflow: 
	You can choose CPU or GPU version, install CPU version, directly under DOS, enter *pip install tensorflow*.
##Keras: 
	Under DOS, type pip install keras.
	
PS:code above is under anaconda prompt. In windows cmd, use py -m pip ... instead.
